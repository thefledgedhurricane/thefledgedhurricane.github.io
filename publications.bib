	abstract = {Human behavior modeling aims to extract and understand patterns of behavior in one's daily life. A seemingly intuitive walk to a destination following a specific path raises questions about the existence of a model that can explain the choices and strategies predetermined by the brain through physical behavior. Tasks such as finding objects, achieving goals, avoiding obstacles, and returning home can be challenging when one lacks navigational abilities. In our previous work. We employed machine learning (ML) approaches to evaluate and classify cognitively challenged individuals to identify crucial markers that could be used to simulate human navigation behavior. However, the challenge lies in the possibility of missing key elements. Our proposed method utilizes deep time series clustering architectures, in which we employ auto-encoders to extract features and then cluster our data using unsupervised machine learning techniques. This approach will provide us with initial insights into human navigation patterns and meaningful clustering. Our developed framework combines unsupervised learning with a dataset obtained from a neuropsychological evaluation in a virtual reality setting called “The VR Magic Carpet”, a variant of “the Corsi block-tapping task”. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This paper presents a comprehensive overview of data augmen-tation techniques in time series analysis, with a specific focus on their applications within deep learning and machine learning. We commence with a systematic methodology for literature selection, curating 757 articles from prominent databases. Subsequent sections delve into various data augmentation techniques, encom-passing traditional approaches like interpolation and advanced methods like Synthetic Data Generation, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). These techniques address complexities inherent in time series data. Moreover, we scrutinize limitations, including computational costs and overfitting risks. However, it’s essential to note that our analysis does not end with limitations. We also comprehensively analyzed the advantages and applicability of the techniques under consideration. This holistic evaluation allows us to provide a balanced perspective. In summary, this overview illuminates data augmentation’s role in time series analysis within deep and machine-learning contexts.

	abstract = {In this paper, we assess human navigation in a virtual reality neuropsychological test named the VR magic carpet; the task involves repeating sequences shown by the test administrator via a VR environment built in Unity. The objective of this assessment is to identify patients with vestibular dysfunction. In earlier work, we used unsupervised classical algorithms on an aggregated participant analysis based on kinematic characteristics, specifically head velocity global average. However, experts mentioned the necessity to analyze further and consider other parameters related to head velocity time series extracted during the clinical trials. Knowing that machine learning techniques are based on hand-crafted features may lead to forgetting essential features. The intuitive solution is embedding deep learning in the analysis process. For that reason, Experts launched clinical trials and labeled the extracted files containing raw 3D spatial data to approach the problem as a classification problem. Furthermore, we used residual neural network topologies, with layers used for feature extraction and classification, to establish an identification model for vestibular dysfunction. The experimental results of the model in this study demonstrate an improvement since they more accurately distinguish between healthy and patients. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},
