abstract: In this paper, we assess human navigation in a virtual reality neuropsychological
  test named the VR magic carpet; the task involves repeating sequences shown by the
  test administrator via a VR environment built in Unity. The objective of this assessment
  is to identify patients with vestibular dysfunction. In earlier work, we used unsupervised
  classical algorithms on an aggregated participant analysis based on kinematic characteristics,
  specifically head velocity global average. However, experts mentioned the necessity
  to analyze further and consider other parameters related to head velocity time series
  extracted during the clinical trials. Knowing that machine learning techniques are
  based on hand-crafted features may lead to forgetting essential features. The intuitive
  solution is embedding deep learning in the analysis process. For that reason, Experts
  launched clinical trials and labeled the extracted files containing raw 3D spatial
  data to approach the problem as a classification problem. Furthermore, we used residual
  neural network topologies, with layers used for feature extraction and classification,
  to establish an identification model for vestibular dysfunction. The experimental
  results of the model in this study demonstrate an improvement since they more accurately
  distinguish between healthy and patients. Â© 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive
