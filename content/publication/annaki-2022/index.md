abstract: Throughout this study, we employed unsupervised machine learning clustering
  algorithms, namely K-Means [1] and hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) [2],
  to explore human locomotion and wayfinding using a VR Magic Carpet (VMC) [3], a
  table test version known as the Corsi Block Tapping task (CBT) [4]. This variation
  was carried out in the context of a virtual reality experimental setup. The participants
  were required to memorize a sequence of target positions projected on the rug and
  walk to each target figuring in the displayed sequence. the participant's trajectory
  was collected and analyzed from a kinematic perspective. An earlier study [5] identified
  three different categories, but the classification remained ambiguous, implying
  that they include both kinds of individuals (normal and patients with cognitive
  spatial impairments). On this basis, we utilized K-Means and HAC to distinguish
  the navigation behavior of patients from normal individuals, emphasizing the most
  important discrepancies and then delving deeper to gain more insights. Â© The Authors.
