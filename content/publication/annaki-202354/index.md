abstract: In this study, We evaluated the efficiency of Multilayer perceptron for
  classification tasks related to cognitive impairments assessed in a virtual reality
  environment and on spatial data, “The VR Magic carpet” In our earlier work, we applied
  machine learning (ML) techniques for assessing and categorizing participants with
  cognitive impairments. The issue stems from the likelihood of not identifying the
  most relevant elements that will provide high accuracy in this navigation disorder
  detection. We used method multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures to benefit from
  using layers for feature extraction on velocity time series and solve our classification
  problem. This navigation disorder identification model was prompt to develop a better
  understanding of targeting users with navigation disorders. The experimental results
  of the model in this study provide an enhancement because it can distinguish with
  more accuracy between healthy individuals and patients. © 2023, The Author(s), under
