abstract: Human behavior modeling aims to extract and understand patterns of behavior
  in one's daily life. A seemingly intuitive walk to a destination following a specific
  path raises questions about the existence of a model that can explain the choices
  and strategies predetermined by the brain through physical behavior. Tasks such
  as finding objects, achieving goals, avoiding obstacles, and returning home can
  be challenging when one lacks navigational abilities. In our previous work. We employed
  machine learning (ML) approaches to evaluate and classify cognitively challenged
  individuals to identify crucial markers that could be used to simulate human navigation
  behavior. However, the challenge lies in the possibility of missing key elements.
  Our proposed method utilizes deep time series clustering architectures, in which
  we employ auto-encoders to extract features and then cluster our data using unsupervised
  machine learning techniques. This approach will provide us with initial insights
  into human navigation patterns and meaningful clustering. Our developed framework
  combines unsupervised learning with a dataset obtained from a neuropsychological
  evaluation in a virtual reality setting called “The VR Magic Carpet”, a variant
  of “the Corsi block-tapping task”. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license
