abstract: In this paper, we use computational tools (Cipresso P, Matic, A, Giakoumis
  D, Ostrovsky Y (2015) Advances in computational psychometrics. Comput Math Methods
  Med. Article ID 418683. https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/418683.5 ) to explore human
  navigation through an example of a visuomotor spatial memory locomotor task, the
  Walking Corsi task (WCT) variant from a well-known table test known as the Corsi
  Block Tapping task [(CBT) [2] and [15]. This variant was performed using the “Virtual
  Carpet” ™ experimental setup. The subjects had to memorize a succession of the position
  of targets projected on the ground and reproduce sequences of 2 to 9 targets by
  walking to each. The trajectory of the head was recorded and processed from a kinematic
  point of view. Generic tools that computational data analytics provides and through
  computer simulations by replicating visually this data allowed categorization of
  the different features of the behavior of the subjects providing a new powerful
  tool for both normal and pathological behavior characterization. © 2021, The Author(s),
