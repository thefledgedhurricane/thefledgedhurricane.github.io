        I develop AI-based approaches, including machine and deep learning for time series, to address real-world challenges in neuroscience and education. By exploring the integration of advanced technologies, my goal is to create practical and innovative solutions to improve educational practices and understanding of cognitive mechanisms.

        I firmly believe that innovation is born from interdisciplinary collaboration. If my work resonates with you, let's connect to exchange ideas and create new solutions together!
