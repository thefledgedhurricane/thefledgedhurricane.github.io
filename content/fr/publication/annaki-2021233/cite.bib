 abstract = {In this paper, we use computational tools (Cipresso P, Matic, A, Giakoumis D, Ostrovsky Y (2015) Advances in computational psychometrics. Comput Math Methods Med. Article ID 418683. https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/418683.5 ) to explore human navigation through an example of a visuomotor spatial memory locomotor task, the Walking Corsi task (WCT) variant from a well-known table test known as the Corsi Block Tapping task [(CBT) [2] and [15]. This variant was performed using the “Virtual Carpet” ™ experimental setup. The subjects had to memorize a succession of the position of targets projected on the ground and reproduce sequences of 2 to 9 targets by walking to each. The trajectory of the head was recorded and processed from a kinematic point of view. Generic tools that computational data analytics provides and through computer simulations by replicating visually this data allowed categorization of the different features of the behavior of the subjects providing a new powerful tool for both normal and pathological behavior characterization. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},
