abstract: Time series data analysis is vital in numerous fields, driven by advancements
  in deep learning and machine learning. This paper presents a comprehensive overview
  of data augmen-tation techniques in time series analysis, with a specific focus
  on their applications within deep learning and machine learning. We commence with
  a systematic methodology for literature selection, curating 757 articles from prominent
  databases. Subsequent sections delve into various data augmentation techniques,
  encom-passing traditional approaches like interpolation and advanced methods like
  Synthetic Data Generation, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Variational
  Autoencoders (VAEs). These techniques address complexities inherent in time series
  data. Moreover, we scrutinize limitations, including computational costs and overfitting
  risks. However, it’s essential to note that our analysis does not end with limitations.
  We also comprehensively analyzed the advantages and applicability of the techniques
  under consideration. This holistic evaluation allows us to provide a balanced perspective.
  In summary, this overview illuminates data augmentation’s role in time series analysis
  within deep and machine-learning contexts. It provides valuable insights for researchers
  and practitioners, advancing these fields and charting paths for future exploration.
