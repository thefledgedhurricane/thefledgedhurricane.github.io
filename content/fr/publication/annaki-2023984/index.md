  In this study, we implemented a spatiotemporal clustering approach to analyze
  the outcome of a virtual reality human navigation neuropsychological assessment (the
  VR Magic Carpet). Our main objective was to establish a clustering of participants
  using a deep multi-step clustering model on velocity signals extracted during clinical
  trials. We used a multi-step neural network architecture to analyze the feature
  extraction and the clustering stage separately. In the feature extraction stage,
  we adopted a 1D-DCAE autoencoder, and for the clustering, we used a soft temporal
  clustering layer, a combination of similarity metrics, K-means, and probability.
  This method enabled us to comprehend, to a certain extent, the clustering results
  in contrast to the joint architecture we had been using before. We obtained five
  significant clusters that are associated with specific clinical groups. Â© 2023,

summary: >
  This paper introduces a spatiotemporal clustering model to analyze neuropsychological
  assessments conducted in a virtual reality environment. The study focuses on
  clustering human navigation behaviors using a deep learning framework that separates
  feature extraction and clustering stages. By applying a 1D-DCAE autoencoder for
  feature extraction and a soft temporal clustering mechanism, the method identifies
  five distinct clusters corresponding to clinical groups. This research contributes
  to understanding navigation patterns in cognitive impairments and advances VR-based
  neuropsychological assessments.
